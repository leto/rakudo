=head1 release_guide.pod - guide to Rakudo releases

Rakudo's development release cycle is based on Parrot's release
cycle.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month; Rakudo
will generally issue its own development release two days after
the Parrot release.

Each development release is given a sequential number and a 
code name based on an active Perl Mongers group.  Rakudo's
February 2009 release is #14; prior releases were bundled as
part of monthly Parrot releases.
